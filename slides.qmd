# A Micro Theory of Crime Opportunities {background-image="img/bicycle.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

Symbolic interaction among motivated offenders, suitable targets, and capable guardians

**Problem**: Macro-level theories have *unarticulated* or *incomplete* micro-level mechanisms

-   Collective efficacy
-   Broken windows
-   Routine activity

. . .

**Goal:** Specify social mechanisms compatible with *core claims* and *empirical evidence*

-   Perception, motivation, meaning
-   Strategic action and selection
-   Inter-level causal mechanisms

*Establish identifying assumptions for macro-analyses*

# Macro-Structural Theories {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

## Collective Efficacy {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="Open Sans", fontcolor="white"]
  edge [color="white"]
  
  a [pos = "1,  0!", label = "Collective\nEfficacy"]
  b [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Disorder"]
  c [pos = "2,  1!", label = "Crime\nRate"]
  
  a -> b
  a -> c

}
```

A recursive macro model

Rooted in *social capital* and *collective action*

## Collective Efficacy {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1" visibility="uncounted"}

```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="Open Sans", fontcolor="white"]
  edge [color="white"]
  
  a [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Collective\nEfficacy"]
  b [pos = "0.5,  0!", label = "Perceived\nSolidarity"]
  c [pos = "2.5,  0!", label = "Intervention"]
  d [pos = "3,  1!", label = "Crime &\nDisorder"]
  e [pos = "-1, 0!", label = "Interactions"]
  
  a -> d
  a -> b [style = "dashed"]
  b -> c [style = "dashed"]
  c -> d [style = "dashed"]
  e -> a
}
```

Efficacy is emergent social structure

Mechanisms typically implied: deterrence, **norms**, **perceptions**



## Broken Windows {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="Open Sans", fontcolor="white"]
  edge [color="white"]
  
  a [pos = "1,  0!", label = "Social\nControl"]
  b [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Disorder"]
  c [pos = "2,  1!", label = "Crime\nRate"]
  
  a -> b
  a -> c
  b -> c
  b -> a
  c -> a [style="dashed"]

}
```

Same elements as collective efficacy but non-recursive

Equilibriating and cascade effects

## Broken Windows {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1" visibility="uncounted"}

```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="Open Sans", fontcolor="white"]
  edge [color="white"]
  
  a [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Disorder"]
  b [pos = "0.5,  0!", label = "Perceived\nSocial\nControl"]
  c [pos = "2.5,  0!", label = "Withdrawal"]
  d [pos = "3,  1!", label = "Reduced\nSocial Control"]
  e [pos = "4.25,  0!", label = "Reduced\nIndividual\nRisk"]
  f [pos = "-1.25,  1!", label = "Social\nControl"]
  
  f -> a
  a -> {b, d}
  b -> c
  c -> d
  c -> e
}
```

Explicit mechanisms: Deterrence, **perceptions**

Recursive with micro-model

**Selection** as an externality problem


## Community Theories {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

* *Collective efficacy* and *broken windows* have incompletely articulated models of situations and individuals

   * Opportunity absent in particular

* Rely heavily on perceptions as mediating mechanisms

   * e.g. disorder, solidarity, support, risk

* Social effects and structures: Emergence, norms, cascades

. . .

*Language of routine activity theory useful for connecting these theories and introducing opportunity*

## Routine Activity {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="Open Sans", fontcolor="white"]
  edge [color="white"]
  
  a [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Routine\nActivities"]
  b [pos = "0.5,  0!", label = "Offender\nTarget\nNo Guardian"]
  c [pos = "2.5,  0!", label = "Crime"]
  d [pos = "3,  1!", label = "Crime\nRate"]
  
  a -> {b, d}
  b -> c
  c -> d
}
```

-   Abstract crime-relevant **roles**
-   Routine activity's micro-theory is a *non-falsifiable postulate*
-   Emphasizes *objective* opportunities and **selection**

## {background-image="img/philadelphia-graffiti.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

*Routine activity theory* provides a simple, **unifying language**

-   Collective efficacy increases real and perceived guardians
-   Disorder increases and signals absence of guardians

. . .

Communities can also control crime by:

-   Hardening targets (e.g., environmental interventions)
-   Excluding offenders (e.g., enforcing boundaries)
-   Invoking guardians (e.g., police, place managers)

. . .

Problems: 

-   No micro-theory of crime-relevant **roles**
-   Objective and **subjective opportunity** may diverge

# A Micro-Theory of Opportunity {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

## {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

We propose a **situational micro-theory** of roles, perception, and motivation based on *criminological theory*[^1] and *pragmatist thought*.<sup>2</sup>

[^1]: Matsueda 1992, 2006; Giordano et al. 2002; 2. Dewey 1922; Mead 1934

. . .

-   Link social structure and physical environment to distribution of crime-relevant roles in space and time
-   Consider strategic actions to alter distributions
-   Specify how situational outcomes change social structures
-   *Highlight challenges for empirical macro-analyses*

## Routine Activity Role-Identities {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

Analytical categories of motivated offender, suitable target, and capable guardian correspond to **social roles**

::: {.fragment}
-   Encompass meanings attributed to self, others, and objects
    * e.g., perceiving others as motivated offenders
:::
::: {.fragment}
-   Vary in **salience** and **commitment**
    * e.g., influencing deterrence susceptibility
:::
::: {.fragment}
-   Shape **habitual** and **deliberate** behavior
    * e.g., governing crime-relevant selection
:::
::: {.fragment}
-   Change as actors redefine situations

## Role-Identities {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.1" visibility="uncounted"}

> For a law-abiding person with little criminal motivation, an unguarded open cash register would mean that someone should alert a sales clerk of a potential problem; for a motivated offender, it would mean that they could steal money with impunity. In other words, what is important is not just the objective opportunity, but rather the opportunity as perceived by the individual, which is based on a priori meanings actors bring into the situation, which are then shaped by the ongoing social process.

## Symbolic Interaction {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

```{dot}
digraph G{
  graph [layout=neato, bgcolor="transparent"]
  
  node [shape = plaintext, fontname="Open Sans", fontcolor="white"]
  edge [color="white"]
  
  sc1 [pos = "0,  1!", label = "Social\nContext"]
  si [pos = "0.5,  0!", label = "Situation"]
  sa [pos = "2.5,  0!", label = "Social\nAction"]
  sc2 [pos = "3,  1!", label = "New\nContext"]
  i1 [pos = "-1, 0!", label = "Identity"]
  i2 [pos = "4, 0!", label = "New\nIdentity"]
  
  {sc1, i1} -> si
  sc1 -> sc2
  si -> sa
  sc1 -> sa [style = "dashed"]
  sa -> {i2, sc2}
}
```

Symbolic interaction elaborates processes of learning, selection into situations, social action, emergence of shared meanings

## {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

We use this framework to clarify assumptions for **identification** and when **micro-processes bias macro-analyses**, e.g.:

-   If subjective opportunities â‰  objective opportunities

    -   Estimated opportunity effects are attenuated
    -   Association declines with novelty / heterogeneity
    -   Adjustment using perception antecedents

. . .

-   If emergence occurs---and where it is expected

    -   Widespread bias unless orthogonal to covariates
        -   Bias Low: Institutionalized settings / homogeneous actors
        -   Bias High: Novel situations / heterogeneous actors
    -   Form determines appropriate design

## Implications for Theory {background-image="img/denver-alley.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

Connects core community theories to broad literature, e.g.:


* Cultural theories<sup>1</sup>

* Situated transactions<sup>2</sup>

* Signal crimes<sup>3</sup>

* Life-course<sup>4</sup>

* Environmental criminology<sup>5</sup>

* Collective action<sup>6</sup>
