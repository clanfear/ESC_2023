Sampson & Smith (2021): cohort-historical perspective on propensity
  Perhaps extend this idea beyond propensity to include all sorts of action and social structures
  e.g., cohort-historical norms? Differences in effects of context/environment?
    A context once criminogenic may not be now
Maybe complain about multiple incompatible theory usage?
  This would require endorsing explicit overall theory and perspective and making individual studies focus on isolated parts of system; this is prob already in Hedstrom or whatever

SAT developmental ecological action model
  Notes activity field changes + person changes as -> changes in crime involvement and nature
  Consider broader system of activity and person changes that fuel larger opportunity system
  Social and self-selection into criminogenic exposure are "causes of causes"

Manski
  Social vs. nonsocial effect identifiability
  Identifying reference groups
    Mobility data?

Moffitt
  Find interventions that act on interactions not on individual incentives
  Consider unique equilibrium might result in long-term return to original state

From CE BE paper:
  "Future research might unite these approaches to specify mobility as both a cause and a consequence of macro-level social structures (e.g., collective efficacy) and micro-level situations (e.g., crime) embedded in a changing built environment (see Lanfear, 2021)."
